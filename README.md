# Sandwich Club Project 

## Project Overview
In this project, I complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project has
helped me better understand how it is processed.

## What I Learnt?
Through this project, you will:
- How to submit projects for review
- JSON parsing to a model object
- Designing an activity layout
- Populating all fields in the layout accordingly
- Brushing up on my Java
